I'm a huge fan of the markup processing tool [Pandoc][#pandoc] and was very
pleased to find it nicely integrated into the static-site compiler tool
[Hakyll][#hakyll]. Markdown via Pandoc is a very productive way to author blog
posts or any documentation in general. For Haskell programmers, Pandoc even lets
us embed Markdown into literate Haskell files. The final productivity multiplier
used for this site was the [Bootstrap][#bootstrap] CSS/JS framework from
Twitter, sprinkled with some icons from [Font Awesome][#fontawesome]. Bootstrap
and its components are configured using CSS styles, so it's very declarative and
easy to use. All in all, it has been a pleasure producing this web site, thanks
to the above free and open-source tools.

I've posted all the source code for this site on github.
