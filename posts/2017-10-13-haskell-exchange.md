Today at the **Haskell Exchange 2017**, I presented “An EDSL for
KDB/Q” (slides available [here][#slides]).  In the talk, I discuss the
rationale for developing an embedded domain specific language (EDSL)
for KDB/Q and the various implementation techniques I used.  It was a
small self-contained project that achieved its goal of reliably
porting a significant amount of Haskell code to KDB/Q in a short
amount of time.  We have **many** interesting projects at Standard Chartered, but this was one that I could actually talk about!
