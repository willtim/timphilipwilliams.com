description: Generic recursion schemes for GADTs using fixed points of higher-order functors.
---

One of my personal favourite applications of category theory applied to typed
functional programming, is datatype generic programming using the fixed points
of functors formed by parametrising the recursion. At my place of work, this
technique has been used to great affect to write a rich set of standardised
recursion schemes that work over many custom data types. In this post, I will
attempt to explain how we have applied this technique to syntax trees defined
using Generalised Algebraic Data Types (GADTs). The jury is still out on whether
the additional type-safety provided by GADTs is worth the added inconvenience of
working with them. I will let the reader decide for themselves rather than offer
an opinion!  Certainly Haskell and its libraries continue to improve in this
area all the time.

Unfortunately we are going to need a fair few extensions to work effectively
with GADTs:

> {-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes           #-}

> {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances    #-}
> {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts     #-}
> {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}
> {-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor        #-}

> import Control.Arrow ((&&&),first)
> import Data.Function (on)
> import Data.Maybe (isJust, fromJust)
> import Data.Monoid
> import Text.PrettyPrint.Leijen

Jumping straight in, for a simple expression abstract syntax datatype, with addition,
multiplication and constants, the *pattern* functor representation would be:

~~~{.haskell}
data ExprF r = Const Int
             | Add r r
             | Mul r r
             deriving Functor

type Expr = Fix ExpF
~~~

with

> newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

An evaluation algebra for the above would thus be:

~~~{.haskell}
eval = cata alg where
  alg :: ExprF Int -> Int
  alg (Const i) = i
  alg (Add a b) = a + b
  alg (Mul a b) = a * b
~~~

where "cata" is the catamorphism defined as:

> cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a
> cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix

The definition of cata can literally be read of the diagram below, with the four
nodes representing types (objects) and the edges representing functions
(morphisms).[^1]

\
![catamorphism](/img/catamorphism.png)\
\

The point of such datatype generic programming is to define the recursion scheme
(i.e. the traversal strategy) once for all pattern functors; only the algebras
need be specific to the datatype. We could just implement, for example, a
catamorphism for every datatype we define, but this approach would quickly get
expensive when working with many additional, sometimes complex, recursion
schemes and large datatype definitions.

Let's now introduce booleans into our expression syntax to support equality
comparisons and conditionals. To do this using vanilla algebraic data types, we
would need to create a new sum datatype which tags our result values as either
integer or boolean:

> data Value = VInt Int | VBool Bool deriving Show

Not only does this have a runtime cost during evaluation, more importantly it does not
prevent incorrectly typed expression trees from being represented.


A GADT representation
---------------------

If we wanted to utilise the newer GADTs to give us an efficient tagless
representation and a type-safe invariant (only type-safe expressions are
representable). We would start by writing down something like this:

~~~{.haskell}
data Expr  :: * -> * where
   Const :: Int -> Expr Int
   Add   :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
   Mul   :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Int
   Cond  :: Expr Bool -> Expr a -> Expr a -> Expr a
   IsEq  :: Expr Int -> Expr Int -> Expr Bool
~~~

Replacing all the points of recursion with a type parameter gives us this:

> data ExprF  :: (* -> *) -> * -> * where
>   Const :: Int -> ExprF r Int
>   Add   :: r Int -> r Int -> ExprF r Int
>   Mul   :: r Int -> r Int -> ExprF r Int
>   Cond  :: r Bool -> r a -> r a -> ExprF r a
>   IsEq  :: r Int -> r Int -> ExprF r Bool

The problem is that ExprF is no longer a functor, so we can't use the recursion
schemes defined for functors, such as cata above. When we tie the recursive
knot, ExprF must become the type constructor Expr which is parametrised by the
type (index) of the expression it represents. The type ExprF is therefore
parametrised by a type constructor and the expression type.  So how do we fix
it? Pun intended. It turns out that we need a higher-order version of Fix,
"HFix".  Note the pattern in the kind signatures below, we obtain the kind
signature required for HFix by substituting `(* -> *)` for `*` in Fix. Redundant
brackets have been added for clarity.

~~~{.haskell}
Fix  :: (* -> *) -> *
HFix :: ((* -> *) -> (* -> *)) -> (* -> *)
~~~

The type declaration of HFix is straightforward and follows from Fix:

> newtype HFix h a = HFix { unHFix :: h (HFix h) a }

We can now write:

> type Expr = HFix ExprF


Higher-order functors
---------------------

Before we can define a recursion scheme for ExprF, we need to be able to map
transformations over it. Our original datatype used for fixing with kind `* -> *`,
had a functor instance. Just as we needed a higher-order version of Fix, we also
need a higher-order, more general, functor definition. Such a higher-order
functor, or HFunctor, would allow the mapping of Functors to Functors inside
it. The type signature for this "hfmap" operation could be written as:

~~~{.haskell}
hfmap :: (forall a. f a -> g a) -> (forall a. h f a -> h g a)
~~~

The functors f ang g (i.e. the recursive structures) being transformed, are
parametrised by the type index a. Note that we require rank 2 universal
quantifiers, because the function argument for hfmap must be polymorphic in the
index type, in other words we need to universally quantify over type
constructors f and g. Such a function is called a *natural transformation* in
category theory and it is common to define the following type operator for it:

> type f :~> g = forall a. f a -> g a

Using this notation, we shall move on to define a class for hfmap, HFunctor.

> class HFunctor (h :: (* -> *) -> * -> *) where
>   hfmap :: (f :~> g) -> h f :~> h g

If you squint a bit, the above should look very familiar. The HFunctor instance
for ExprF is very simple and is as follows:

> instance HFunctor ExprF where
>   hfmap f (Const i) = Const i
>   hfmap f (Add x y) = Add (f x) (f y)
>   hfmap f (Mul x y) = Mul (f x) (f y)
>   hfmap f (Cond x y z) = Cond (f x) (f y) (f z)
>   hfmap f (IsEq x y) = IsEq (f x) (f y)

For the higher-order recursion schemes, we can mechanically derive them from the
vanilla Functor versions. For example, here is cata (again) and hcata.

~~~{.haskell}
cata :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> Fix f -> b
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . unFix
~~~

> hcata :: HFunctor h => (h f :~> f) -> HFix h :~> f
> hcata alg = alg . hfmap (hcata alg) . unHFix

Note that hcata folds to a functor f and not to a value. So to write an
evaluation alegbra we will need an identity functor:

> newtype I x = I { unI :: x }
> 
> eval :: Expr a -> a
> eval = unI . hcata evalAlg
>
> evalAlg :: ExprF I :~> I
> evalAlg (Const i) = I i
> evalAlg (Add x y) = I $ unI x + unI y
> evalAlg (Mul x y) = I $ unI x * unI y
> evalAlg (Cond x y z) = I $ if unI x then unI y else unI z
> evalAlg (IsEq x y) = I $ unI x == unI y

The newtype wrapping and unwrapping is rather irratating, but has no runtime
cost as the newtype constructors are removed during compilation. We could have
defined Functor and Applicative instances for `I` and lifted the application of
e.g. `(+)` into `I`; but without idiom brackets[^2], I personally don't think
this makes the above more readable.  The GHC ViewPatterns extension can also be
used to move the unwrapping noise to the left handside of the equations, if
preferred.

Let's test it with some example expressions:

> x :: Expr Bool
> x = HFix (IsEq (HFix (Add (HFix (Const 1)) (HFix (Const 2)))) (HFix (Const 3)))

> y :: Expr Int
> y = HFix (Cond x (HFix (Const 1)) (HFix (Const 2)))

~~~
λ> eval x
True
λ> eval y
1
~~~

The interspersed HFix is also a mild inconvenience, but this could be hidden by defining
new (smart) constructors, or perhaps an isomorphism with an unfixed representation.

If we want our fold to produce a final value of a constant type, independent of
the expression type index, we will need the constant functor `K`. For example,
we'll need `K` in order to define a pretty-printer:

> newtype K x y = K { unK :: x }

> ppr :: Expr a -> Doc
> ppr = unK . hcata alg where
>   alg :: ExprF (K Doc) :~> K Doc
>   alg (Const i) = K . text $ show i
>   alg (Add x y) = K . parens $ unK x <+> text "+" <+> unK y
>   alg (Mul x y) = K . parens $ unK x <+> text "*" <+> unK y
>   alg (Cond x y z) = K $ text "if" <+> unK x <+>
>                      text "then" <+> unK y <+> text "else" <+> unK z
>   alg (IsEq x y) = K $ unK x <+> text "==" <+> unK y

~~~
λ> ppr x
(1 + 2) == 3
λ> ppr y
if (1 + 2) == 3 then 1 else 2
~~~

For the common case of folding to a monoid, we can instead implement a
higher-order analogue of the Foldable type class, starting with an "hfoldMap"
method:

> -- | Higher-order analogue of Foldable
> class HFoldable (h :: (* -> *) -> * -> *) where
>   hfoldMap :: Monoid m => (forall b. f b -> m) -> h f a -> m
 
> instance HFoldable ExprF where
>   hfoldMap _ (Const _) = mempty
>   hfoldMap f (Add x y) = f x `mappend` f y
>   hfoldMap f (Mul x y) = f x `mappend` f y
>   hfoldMap f (Cond x y z) = f x `mappend` f y `mappend` f z
>   hfoldMap f (IsEq x y) = f x `mappend` f y

Note that we cannot use the standard class in Data.Foldable as we require the
supplied monoid constructor to be polymorphic in the type-index. To be
theoretically correct and avoid problems adding more higher-order analogues, we
should really define a type-indexed monoid, but we'll stop short of that in
order to use all the existing monoid instances out there.

Let's use the above to count the number of expression nodes, making use of hcata
and hfoldMap:

> size :: Expr a -> Int
> size = getSum . unK . hcata alg where
>   alg :: ExprF (K (Sum Int)) :~> K (Sum Int)
>   alg x = K $ Sum 1 `mappend` hfoldMap unK x

~~~
λ> size x
5
λ> size y
8
~~~


Equality
--------

We are at some point going to want to compare two type-indexed expressions for
equality.  The simplest way to achieve this would be to created an "untyped"
vanilla ADT version of our expression type with a deriving clause for Eq and
Ord; and an isomorphism (bijective mapping) between it and our GADT
representation. However, with more work, we can arrive at a more efficient and
flexible solution.

First we'll define a new class for defining equality for terms of type `f a` where
`a` is universally qualified. This is purely a convenience to help arrive ultimately
at an instance for `Eq (Expr a)` without having to create Eq instances for every
context and type-index combination.

> -- | Higher-order analogue of Eq
> class HEq (f :: * -> *) where
>   heq :: f a -> f a -> Bool
 
> instance HEq (f (HFix f)) => HEq (HFix f) where heq = heq `on` unHFix

For our ExprF datatype, we need the following instances:

> instance HEq r => Eq (ExprF r a) where
>   Const x1 == Const x2 = x1 == x2
>   Add x1 x2 == Add y1 y2 = heq x1 y1 && heq x2 y2
>   Mul x1 x2 == Mul y1 y2 = heq x1 y1 && heq x2 y2
>   Cond x1 x2 x3 == Cond y1 y2 y3 = heq x1 y1 && heq x2 y2 && heq x3 y3
>   IsEq x1 x2 == IsEq y1 y2 = heq x1 y1 && heq x2 y2
>
> instance HEq r => HEq (ExprF r) where heq = (==)
> instance Eq (Expr a) where (==) = (==) `on` unHFix

Let's test all this equality machinery:

~~~
λ> HFix (Const 1) == HFix (Const 1)
True
λ> HFix (Const 1) == HFix (Const 2)
False
λ> x == y
Couldn't match expected type `Bool' with actual type `Int' ...
~~~

Expressions of the same type index compare with (==), but otherwise we get a
type error. This will not always be what we want; a *heterogenous* equality
comparison would allow us to compare expressions with potentially different
type indices for equality. One likely use case for this is adding an expression
term to a homogeneous container, such as a List, using an existential wrapper:

> data Some f = forall a. Some (f a)

which we can later eliminate with:

> some :: (forall a. f a -> b) -> Some f -> b
> some f (Some x) = f x

Using the above, a list of our expressions would have type `[Some Expr]`. To test
for membership we would need an additional Eq instance for Some; and the
definition would need to make use of a heterogeneous equality test. In order to
achieve this, we will unfortunately need to reify the type index into an
associated singleton value, so we start by defining these "type tags":

> -- | singleton type tags that witness the expression type at runtime
> data Type :: * -> * where
>   TBool :: Type Bool
>   TInt  :: Type Int

The goal of the above type tags is to deliver evidence to the type-checker that the
type indices represented by the tags are equal. For this purpose, we define a
new datatype:

> -- | Evidence that two types are equal
> data x :=: y where
>   Refl :: x :=: x

We'll define a new type-class "HEqHet" to support our heterogeneous equality
comparison "heqHet"; and make use of a helper method "heqIdx", which returns
evidence of index equality if the indexes are the same type, but ignores the
structure. It turns out that this helper method is the only missing piece that
we need to implement heterogeneous equality, as `heq` will take care of
structural equality. We can thus provide a default implementation for `heqHet`
which makes use of `heqIdx` and `heq`.

> class HEq f => HEqHet f where
>   -- | type-index equality
>   heqIdx :: f a -> f b -> Maybe (a :=: b)
>   -- | heterogeneous equality
>   heqHet :: f a -> f b -> Maybe (a :=: b)
>   heqHet x y = case heqIdx x y of
>     Just Refl | x `heq` y -> Just Refl
>     _                     -> Nothing
 
> instance (HEq f, HEqHet f) => Eq (Some f) where
>   Some x == Some y = isJust $ x `heqHet` y

Finally, we implement type index equality `heqIdx` for our type-tag singletons
and expression type, needed by the heterogeneous equality `heqHet` default
method.

> instance HEqHet Expr where
>   heqIdx x y = heqIdx (getType x) (getType y)
>
> getType :: Expr a -> Type a
> getType e = case unHFix e of
>   Const {}   -> TInt
>   Add   {}   -> TInt
>   Mul   {}   -> TInt
>   Cond _ e _ -> getType e
>   IsEq  {}   -> TBool
>
> instance HEqHet Type where
>   heqIdx TBool TBool = Just Refl
>   heqIdx TInt TInt   = Just Refl
>   heqIdx _ _         = Nothing
> 
> instance HEq Type where
>   heq TBool TBool = True
>   heq TInt  TInt  = True
>   heq _     _     = False

Now the machinery is in place, let's try out a heterogeneous equality test: 

~~~
λ> isJust $ x `heqHet` x
True
λ> isJust $ x `heqHet` y
False
~~~

Recall that the ultimate aim was this:
~~~
λ> elem (Some x) [Some x, Some y]
True
~~~

Of course, for tree-based Maps and Sets we will need an Ord instance for Some
and Expr. We will omit the classes and instances for Ord in these notes, but the
treatment proceeds in a similar fashion as the Eq case.


Example: A tracing evaluator
----------------------------

For a final example that uses many of the constructs we've defined so
far, we'll implement a tracing evaluator that returns the values of all the
intermediate subterms. To accomplish this, we'll make use of another recursion
scheme, a paramorphism. The supplied function for a paramorphism gets both the
recursively computed value and the original subterm used to compute it. A
paramorphism is just a convenient way of getting access to the original input
structures; it could be defined as a catamorphism, although it would be less
efficient to do so.

The definition of a paramorphism can be arrived at by a small modification to
our catamorphism, we fmap the lambda `\x -> (para alg, x)` or alternatively
`(para alg &&& id)`, which gives us a the original subterm as the second element
of the argument pair.

For vanilla functors, a paramorphism is thus:

~~~{.haskell}
para :: Functor f => (f (a, Fix f) -> a) -> Fix f -> a
para psi = psi . fmap (para psi &&& id) . unFix
~~~

To define a paramorphism for higher-order functors, we'll need some additional
higher-order analogues:

> -- | The product of functors
> data (f :*: g) a = (:*:) { hfst :: f a, hsnd :: g a }
> infixr 6 :*:
>
> -- | The higher-order analogue of (&&&) for functor products
> (&&&&) :: (f :~> g) -> (f :~> g') -> f :~> (g :*: g')
> (&&&&) u v x = u x :*: v x
> infixr 3 &&&&
> 
> -- | paramorphism for higher-order functors
> hpara :: HFunctor h => (h (f :*: HFix h) :~> f) -> (HFix h :~> f)
> hpara psi = psi . hfmap (hpara psi &&&& id) . unHFix

The tracing evaluator will need to return a container mapping expression
subterms to values. We'll use an association list to avoid needing to define Ord
instances:

> type Result = [(Some Expr, Value)]

Note that we have made use of our existential wrapper `Some` and the value
wrapper type `Value` from earlier. We'll also demonstrate the use of type-tags
and our getType function to recover tagged values for storing into the list.

The implementation of our tracing evaluator is as follows:

> evalTrace :: Expr a -> Result
> evalTrace = unK . hsnd . hpara psi where
>   psi :: ExprF ((I :*: K Result) :*: Expr) :~> (I :*: K Result)
>   psi n = I v :*: (K $ (Some e, v') : m)
>      where
>        v  = unI . evalAlg $ hfmap (hfst . hfst) n
>        m  = hfoldMap unK  $ hfmap (hsnd . hfst) n
>        e  = HFix          $ hfmap hsnd n
>        v' = mkValue (getType e) v
> 
> mkValue :: Type a -> a -> Value
> mkValue TBool x = VBool x
> mkValue TInt  x = VInt  x

Note that we are of course using an evaluation algebra instead of our eval
function introduced earlier, as we do not want to introduce any additional
traversals. One disadvantage of using a paramorphism, is that it makes it
difficult to arrive at a solution to the above by combining F-algebras.

~~~
λ> map (first $ some ppr) $ evalTrace y
[(if (1 + 2) == 3 then 1 else 2,VInt 1),((1 + 2) == 3,VBool True),((1 + 2),VInt 3),(1,VInt 1),(2,VInt 2),(3,VInt 3),(1,VInt 1),(2,VInt 2)]
~~~

The HFunctor has also proved useful for both nested vanilla algebraic datatypes
[1] and generic mutual recursion [2]. Further reading on HFunctor applied to
GADTs can be found here [3].
